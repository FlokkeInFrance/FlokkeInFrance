- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FlokkeInFrance
After developping for other fields like office organisation, flight simulation, I'm now undertaking a new project for sailors. Computers are now almost as valuable as another crew member. Most aspects of software developped for sailors concern navigation. I'm confident that other solutions to help improve life aboard will be coded as well. I'm currently undertaking a new project to develop a program which will help organise meals on board, covering all aspects : menus, recepies, dietetics, shopping, inventory management, tool management. It will be a skeleton, built in C++ around sqlite using the Qt IDE. Skippers or crews can over the years enrich the content of the database to reflect their experience with this aspect of cruising life. If people like it, communities could share content, I'll code the endpoints which would enable that. 

The program will be freeware. I will provide all code here under the GNU GPL licence.

My ETA is currently end of the year 2022 for the PC based program, I'll learn later how to code for IOS and Android so that I'll be able to make some helper code for those platforms as well (like running the shopping list and/or checking the inventory).
